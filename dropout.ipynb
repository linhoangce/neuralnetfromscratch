    "Another option for neural network regularization is adding a **dropout layer**. This type of layer disables some neurons, while the others pass through unchanged. The idea here, similarly to regularization, is to prevent a neural network from becoming too dependent on any neuron or for any neuron to be relied upon entirely in a specific instance (which can be common if a model overfits the training data). Another problem dropout can help with is **co-adoption**, which happens when neurons depend on the output values of other neurons and do not learn the underlying function on their onw. Dropout can also help with **noise** and other pertubations in the training data as more neurons working together mean that the model can learn more complex functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dropout function works by randomly disabling neurons at a given rate during every forward pass, forcing the network to learn how to make accurate predictions with only a random part of neurons remaining. Dropout forces the model to use more neurons for the same purpose, resulting in a higher chance of learning the underlying function that describes the data. For example, if we disbale one half of the neurons during the current step, and the other half during the next step, we are forcing more neurons to learn the data, as only a part of them \"see\" the data and gets updates in a given pass. These alternating halves of neurons are an example, and in reality, we'll use a hyperparameter to inform the dropout layer of the number of neurons to disable randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, since active neurons are changing, dropout helps prevent overfitting, as the model can't use specific neurons to memorize certain samples. It's also worth mentioning that the dropuout layer does not truly disable neurons, but instead zeros their output. In other words, dropout does not decrease the number of neurons used, nor does it make the training process twice as fast when half the neurons are disabled."

    "While dropout helps a neural network generalize and is helpful for training, it's not something we want to utilize when predicting. It's not as simple as only omitting it becayse the magnitude of inputs to the next neurons can be dramatically different. If we have a dropout of 50%, for example, this would suggest that, on average, our inputs to the next layer neurons will be 50% smaller when summed, assuming they are fully-connected. What that means is that we used dropout during training, and, in this example, a random 50% of neuron output a value of 0 at each of the steps. Neurons in the next layer multiply inputs by weights, sum them, and receive values of 0 for half of their inputs. If we don't use dropout during prediction, all neurons will output their values, and this state won't match the state seen during training, since the sums will be statistically about twice as big. To handle this, during prediction, we might multiply all of the outputs by the dropout fraction, but that'd add another step for the forward pass, and there is a better way to achieve this. Instead, we want to scale the data back up after a dropout, during the training phase, to mimic the mean of the sum when all of the neurons output their values.\n",
